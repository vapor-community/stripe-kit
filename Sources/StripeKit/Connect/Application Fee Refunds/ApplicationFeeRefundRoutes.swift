    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - fee: The identifier of the application fee to be refunded.
    ///   - amount: A positive integer, in `cents`, representing how much of this fee to refund. Can refund only up to the remaining unrefunded amount of the fee.
    ///   - metadata: Set of key-value pairs that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Individual keys can be unset by posting an empty value to them. All keys can be unset by posting an empty value to `metadata`.
    ///   - expand: Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
    /// - Returns: Returns the `Application Fee Refund` object if the refund succeeded. Returns an error if the fee has already been refunded, or if an invalid fee identifier was provided.

Each entry in the array is a separate application fee refund object. If no more refunds are available, the resulting array will be empty.
