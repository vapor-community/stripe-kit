    ///   - email: Customer’s email address. It’s displayed alongside the customer in your dashboard and can be useful for searching and tracking. This may be up to 512 characters.
    ///   - metadata: Set of key-value pairs that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Individual keys can be unset by posting an empty value to them. All keys can be unset by posting an empty value to metadata.
    ///   - name: The customer’s full name or business name.
    ///   - paymentMethod: The ID of the PaymentMethod to attach to the customer.
    ///   - phone: The customer’s phone number.
    ///   - shipping: The customer’s shipping information. Appears on invoices emailed to this customer.
    ///   - balance: An integer amount in cents that represents the customer’s current balance, which affect the customer’s future invoices. A negative amount represents a credit that decreases the amount due on an invoice; a positive amount increases the amount due on an invoice.
    ///   - cashBalance: Balance information and default balance settings for this customer.
    ///   - coupon: If you provide a coupon code, the customer will have a discount applied on all recurring charges. Charges you create through the API will not have the discount.
    ///   - invoicePrefix: The prefix for the customer used to generate unique invoice numbers. Must be 3–12 uppercase letters or numbers.
    ///   - invoiceSettings: Default invoice settings for this customer.
    ///   - nextInvoiceSequence: The sequence to be used on the customer’s next invoice. Defaults to 1.
    ///   - preferredLocales: Customer’s preferred languages, ordered by preference.
    ///   - promotionCode: The API ID of a promotion code to apply to the customer. The customer will have a discount applied on all recurring payments. Charges you create through the API will not have the discount.
    ///   - source: When using payment sources created via the Token or Sources APIs, passing source will create a new source object, make it the new customer default source, and delete the old customer default if one exists. If you want to add additional sources instead of replacing the existing default, use the card creation API. Whenever you attach a card to a customer, Stripe will automatically validate the card.
    ///   - tax: Tax details about the customer.
    ///   - taxExempt: The customer’s tax exemption. One of none, exempt, or reverse.
    ///   - taxIdData: The customer’s tax IDs.
    ///   - testClock: ID of the test clock to attach to the customer.
    ///   - expand: Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
    /// - Returns: Returns the customer object if the update succeeded. Returns an error if create parameters are invalid (e.g. specifying an invalid coupon or an invalid source).

When you update a customer to a new valid card source by passing the `source` parameter: for each of the customer’s current subscriptions, if the subscription bills automatically and is in the `past_due` state, then the latest open invoice for the subscription with automatic collection enabled will be retried. This retry will not count as an automatic retry, and will not affect the next regularly scheduled payment for the invoice. Changing the `default_source` for a customer will not trigger this behavior.
