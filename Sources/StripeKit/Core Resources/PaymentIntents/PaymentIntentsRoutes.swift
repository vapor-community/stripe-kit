public protocol PaymentIntentsRoutes {
    /// Creates a PaymentIntent object.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - amount: A positive integer representing how much to charge in the smallest currency unit (e.g., 100 cents to charge $1.00 or 100 to charge ¥100, a zero-decimal currency). The minimum amount is $0.50 US or equivalent in charge currency.
    ///   - currency: Three-letter ISO currency code, in lowercase. Must be a supported currency.
    ///   - applicationFeeAmount: The amount of the application fee (if any) that will be applied to the payment and transferred to the application owner’s Stripe account. For more information, see the PaymentIntents Connect usage guide.
    ///   - captureMethod: Capture method of this PaymentIntent, one of `automatic` or `manual`.
    ///   - confirm: Set to `true` to attempt to confirm this PaymentIntent immediately. This parameter defaults to `false`. If the payment method attached is a card, a return_url may be provided in case additional authentication is required.
    ///   - confirmationMethod: One of `automatic` (default) or `manual`. /n When the confirmation method is `automatic`, a PaymentIntent can be confirmed using a publishable key. After `next_actions` are handled, no additional confirmation is required to complete the payment. /n When the confirmation method is` manual`, all payment attempts must be made using a secret key. The PaymentIntent will return to the `requires_confirmation` state after handling `next_actions`, and requires your server to initiate each payment attempt with an explicit confirmation. Read the expanded documentation to learn more about manual confirmation.
    ///   - customer: ID of the customer this PaymentIntent is for if one exists.
    ///   - description: An arbitrary string attached to the object. Often useful for displaying to users. This will be unset if you POST an empty value.
    ///   - errorOnRequiresAction: Set to true to fail the payment attempt if the PaymentIntent transitions into `requires_action`. This parameter is intended for simpler integrations that do not handle customer actions, like saving cards without authentication. This parameter can only be used with `confirm=true`.
    ///   - mandate: ID of the mandate to be used for this payment. This parameter can only be used with confirm=true.
    ///   - mandateData: This hash contains details about the Mandate to create. This parameter can only be used with confirm=true.
    ///   - metadata: Set of key-value pairs that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format.
    ///   - offSession: Set to true to indicate that the customer is not in your checkout flow during this payment attempt, and therefore is unable to authenticate. This parameter is intended for scenarios where you collect card details and charge them later. This parameter can only be used with confirm=true.
    ///   - onBehalfOf: The Stripe account ID for which these funds are intended. For details, see the PaymentIntents Connect usage guide.
    ///   - paymentMethod: ID of the payment method to attach to this PaymentIntent.
    ///   - paymentMethodData: If provided, this hash will be used to create a PaymentMethod. The new PaymentMethod will appear in the `payment_method` property on the PaymentIntent.
    ///   - paymentMethodOptions: Payment-method-specific configuration for this PaymentIntent.
    ///   - paymentMethodTypes: The list of payment method types that this PaymentIntent is allowed to use. If this is not provided, defaults to `[“card”]`. Valid payment method types include: `acss_debit` `alipay` `au_becs_debit` `bancontact` `card` `card_present` `eps` `giropay` `ideal` `p24` `sepa_debit` and `sofort`.
    ///   - receiptEmail: Email address that the receipt for the resulting payment will be sent to.
    ///   - returnUrl: The URL to redirect your customer back to after they authenticate or cancel their payment on the payment method’s app or site. If you’d prefer to redirect to a mobile application, you can alternatively supply an application URI scheme. This parameter can only be used with confirm=true.
    ///   - setupFutureUsage: Indicates that you intend to make future payments with this PaymentIntent’s payment method. If present, the payment method used with this PaymentIntent can be attached to a Customer, even after the transaction completes. Use `on_session` if you intend to only reuse the payment method when your customer is present in your checkout flow. Use `off_session` if your customer may or may not be in your checkout flow. For more, learn to save card details after a payment. Stripe uses `setup_future_usage` to dynamically optimize your payment flow and comply with regional legislation and network rules. For example, if your customer is impacted by SCA, using `off_session` will ensure that they are authenticated while processing this PaymentIntent. You will then be able to collect off-session payments for this customer.
    ///   - shipping: Shipping information for this PaymentIntent.
    ///   - statementDescriptor: For non-card charges, you can use this value as the complete description that appears on your customers’ statements. Must contain at least one letter, maximum 22 characters.
    ///   - statementDescriptorSuffix: Provides information about a card payment that customers see on their statements. Concatenated with the prefix (shortened descriptor) or statement descriptor that’s set on the account to form the complete statement descriptor. Maximum 22 characters for the concatenated descriptor.
    ///   - transferData: The parameters used to automatically create a Transfer when the payment succeeds. For more information, see the PaymentIntents Connect usage guide.
    ///   - transferGroup: A string that identifies the resulting payment as part of a group. See the PaymentIntents Connect usage guide for details.
    ///   - useStripeSDK: Set to true only when using manual confirmation and the iOS or Android SDKs to handle additional authentication steps.
    ///   - expand: An array of properties to expand.
    /// - Returns: A `StripePaymentIntent`.
