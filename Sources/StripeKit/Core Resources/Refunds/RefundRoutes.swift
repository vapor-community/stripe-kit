public protocol RefundRoutes {
    /// When you create a new refund, you must specify a charge on which to create it. /n Creating a new refund will refund a charge that has previously been created but not yet refunded. Funds will be refunded to the credit or debit card that was originally charged. /n You can optionally refund only part of a charge. You can do so multiple times, until the entire charge has been refunded. /n Once entirely refunded, a charge can’t be refunded again. This method will return an error when called on an already-refunded charge, or whening to refund more money than is left on a charge.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - charge: The identifier of the charge to refund.
    ///   - amount: A positive integer in cents representing how much of this charge to refund. Can refund only up to the remaining, unrefunded amount of the charge.
    ///   - metadata: A set of key-value pairs that you can attach to a `Refund` object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the refund in a structured format. You can unset individual keys if you POST an empty value for that key. You can clear all keys if you POST an empty value for `metadata`
    ///   - paymentIntent: ID of the PaymentIntent to refund.
    ///   - reason: String indicating the reason for the refund. If set, possible values are `duplicate`, `fraudulent`, and `requested_by_customer`. If you believe the charge to be fraudulent, specifying `fraudulent` as the reason will add the associated card and email to your blocklists, and will also help us improve our fraud detection algorithms.
    ///   - refundApplicationFee: Boolean indicating whether the application fee should be refunded when refunding this charge. If a full charge refund is given, the full application fee will be refunded. Otherwise, the application fee will be refunded in an amount proportional to the amount of the charge refunded. /n An application fee can be refunded only by the application that created the charge.
    ///   - reverseTransfer: Boolean indicating whether the transfer should be reversed when refunding this charge. The transfer will be reversed proportionally to the amount being refunded (either the entire or partial amount). /n A transfer can be reversed only by the application that created the charge.
    ///   - expand: An array of properties to expand.
    /// - Returns: A `StripeRefund`.
