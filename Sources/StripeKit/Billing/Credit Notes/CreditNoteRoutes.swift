    /// Issue a credit note to adjust the amount of a finalized invoice. For a `status=open` invoice, a credit note reduces its `amount_due`. For a `status=paid` invoice, a credit note does not affect its `amount_due`. Instead, it can result in any combination of the following:
    ///
    /// - Refund: create a new refund (using `refund_amount`) or link an existing refund (using `refund`).
    /// - Customer balance credit: credit the customer’s balance (using `credit_amount`) which will be automatically applied to their next invoice when it’s finalized.
    /// - Outside of Stripe credit: record the amount that is or will be credited outside of Stripe (using `out_of_band_amount`).
    ///
    ///  For post-payment credit notes the sum of the refund, credit and outside of Stripe amounts must equal the credit note total.
    ///
    ///  You may issue multiple credit notes for an invoice. Each credit note will increment the invoice’s `pre_payment_credit_notes_amount` or `post_payment_credit_notes_amount` depending on its `status` at the time of credit note creation.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - invoice: ID of the invoice.
    ///   - lines: Line items that make up the credit note.
    ///   - memo: The credit note’s memo appears on the credit note PDF. This will be unset if you POST an empty value.
    ///   - metadata: Set of key-value pairs that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Individual keys can be unset by posting an empty value to them. All keys can be unset by posting an empty value to `metadata`.
    ///   - reason: Reason for issuing this credit note, one of `duplicate`, `fraudulent`, `order_change`, or `product_unsatisfactory`
    ///   - amount: The integer amount in cents representing the total amount of the credit note.
    ///   - creditAmount: The integer amount in cents representing the amount to credit the customer’s balance, which will be automatically applied to their next invoice.
    ///   - outOfBandAmount: The integer amount in `cents` representing the amount that is credited outside of Stripe.
    ///   - refund: ID of an existing refund to link this credit note to.
    ///   - refundAmount: The integer amount in cents representing the amount to refund. If set, a refund will be created for the charge associated with the invoice.
    ///   - shippingCost: When `shipping_cost` contains the `shipping_rate` from the invoice, the `shipping_cost` is included in the credit note.
    ///   - expand: Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
    /// - Returns: A `StripeCreditNote`.
