    ///   - currency: The currency to create this invoice in. Defaults to that of customer if not specified.
    ///   - customFields: A list of up to 4 custom fields to be displayed on the invoice.
    ///   - daysUntilDue: The number of days from when the invoice is created until it is due. Valid only for invoices where `billing=send_invoice`.

    ///   - defaultSource: ID of the default payment source for the invoice. It must belong to the customer associated with the invoice and be in a chargeable state. If not set, defaults to the subscription’s default source, if any, or to the customer’s default source.

    ///   - footer: Footer to be displayed on the invoice. This will be unset if you POST an empty value.

    ///   - pendingInvoiceItemsBehavior: How to handle pending invoice items on invoice creation. One of include or exclude. include will include any pending invoice items, and will create an empty draft invoice if no pending invoice items exist. exclude will always create an empty invoice draft regardless if there are pending invoice items or not. Defaults to exclude if the parameter is omitted.
    ///   - renderingOptions: Options for invoice PDF rendering.
    ///   - shippingCost: Settings for the cost of shipping for this invoice.

If not specified and this invoice is part of a subscription, the default `statement_descriptor` will be set to the first subscription item’s product’s `statement_descriptor`.

To ensure that the actual proration is calculated exactly the same as the previewed proration, you should pass a `proration_date` parameter when doing the actual subscription update. The value passed in should be the same as the `subscription_proration_date` returned on the upcoming invoice resource.
