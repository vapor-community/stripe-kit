    ///   - collectionMethod: Either `charge_automatically`, or `send_invoice`. When charging automatically, Stripe will attempt to pay this invoice using the default source attached to the customer. When sending an invoice, Stripe will email this invoice to the customer with payment instructions. Defaults to `charge_automatically`.
    ///   - customFields: A list of up to 4 custom fields to be displayed on the invoice.
    ///   - daysUntilDue: The number of days from when the invoice is created until it is due. Valid only for invoices where `billing=send_invoice`.

    ///   - description: An arbitrary string attached to the object. Often useful for displaying to users. Referenced as ‘memo’ in the Dashboard.
    ///   - discounts: The coupons to redeem into discounts for the invoice. If not specified, inherits the discount from the invoice’s customer. Pass an empty string to avoid inheriting any discounts.
    ///   - dueDate: The date on which payment for this invoice is due. Valid only for invoices where `billing=send_invoice`.
    ///   - footer: Footer to be displayed on the invoice. This will be unset if you POST an empty value.
    ///   - metadata: Set of key-value pairs that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Individual keys can be unset by posting an empty value to them. All keys can be unset by posting an empty value to metadata.
    ///   - onBehalfOf: The account (if any) for which the funds of the invoice payment are intended. If set, the invoice will be presented with the branding and support information of the specified account. See the Invoices with Connect documentation for details.
    ///   - paymentSettings: Configuration settings for the PaymentIntent that is generated when the invoice is finalized.
    ///   - statementDescriptor: Extra information about a charge for the customer’s credit card statement. It must contain at least one letter.

As such, the upcoming invoice will not show up in invoice listing calls, and you cannot use the API to pay or edit the invoice. If you want to change the amount that your customer will be billed, you can add, remove, or update pending invoice items, or update the customer’s discount. /n You can preview the effects of updating a subscription, including a preview of what proration will take place. To ensure that the actual proration is calculated exactly the same as the previewed proration, you should pass a `proration_date` parameter when doing the actual subscription update. The value passed in should be the same as the `subscription_proration_date` returned on the upcoming invoice resource. The recommended way to get only the prorations being previewed is to consider only proration line items where `period[start]` is equal to the `subscription_proration_date` on the upcoming invoice resource.
