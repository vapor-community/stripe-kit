For `collection_method=charge_automatically` a subscription moves into `incomplete` if the initial payment attempt fails. A subscription in this state can only have metadata and `default_source` updated. Once the first invoice is paid, the subscription moves into an active state. If the first invoice is not paid within 23 hours, the subscription transitions to `incomplete_expired`. This is a terminal state, the open invoice will be voided and no further invoices will be generated. A subscription that is currently in a trial period is trialing and moves to active when the trial period is over. If subscription `collection_method=charge_automatically` it becomes `past_due` when payment to renew it fails and canceled or unpaid (depending on your subscriptions settings) when Stripe has exhausted all payment retry attempts. If subscription `collection_method=send_invoice` it becomes `past_due` when its invoice is not paid by the due date, and `canceled` or `unpaid` if it is still not paid by an additional deadline after that. Note that when a subscription has a status of `unpaid`, no subsequent invoices will be attempted (invoices will be created, but then immediately automatically closed). After receiving updated payment information from a customer, you may choose to reopen and pay their closed invoices.
