public protocol SubscriptionRoutes: StripeAPIRoute {
    /// Creates a new subscription on an existing customer. Each customer can have up to 500 active or scheduled subscriptions.
    ///
    /// When you create a subscription with `collection_method=charge_automatically`, the first invoice is finalized as part of the request. The `payment_behavior` parameter determines the exact behavior of the initial payment.
    
    /// To start subscriptions where the first invoice always begins in a `draft` status, use [subscription schedules](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/subscription-schedules#managing) instead. Schedules provide the flexibility to model more complex billing configurations that change over time.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - customer: The identifier of the customer to subscribe
    ///   - items: A list of up to 20 subscription items, each with an attached price.
    ///   - cancelAtPeriodEnd: Boolean indicating whether this subscription should cancel at the end of the current period.
    ///   - currency: Three-letter ISO currency code, in lowercase. Must be a supported currency.
    ///   - defaultPaymentMethod: ID of the default payment method for the subscription. It must belong to the customer associated with the subscription. If not set, invoices will use the default payment method in the customer’s invoice settings.
    ///   - description: The subscription’s description, meant to be displayable to the customer. Use this field to optionally store an explanation of the subscription for rendering in Stripe surfaces.
    ///   - metadata: A set of key-value pairs that you can attach to a Subscription object. It can be useful for storing additional information about the subscription in a structured format.
    ///   - paymentBehavior: Use `allow_incomplete` to create subscriptions with `status=incomplete` if its first invoice cannot be paid. Creating subscriptions with this status allows you to manage scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. For example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior. Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription’s first invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not create a subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more. `pending_if_incomplete` is only used with updates and cannot be passed when creating a subscription.
    ///   - addInvoiceItems: A list of prices and quantities that will generate invoice items appended to the first invoice for this subscription. You may pass up to 10 items.
    ///   - applicationFeePercent: A non-negative decimal between 0 and 100, with at most two decimal places. This represents the percentage of the subscription invoice subtotal that will be transferred to the application owner’s Stripe account. The request must be made with an OAuth key in order to set an application fee percentage. For more information, see the application fees documentation.
    ///   - automaticTax: Automatic tax settings for this subscription. We recommend you only include this parameter when the existing value is being changed.
    ///   - backdateStartDate: For new subscriptions, a past timestamp to backdate the subscription’s start date to. If set, the first invoice will contain a proration for the timespan between the start date and the current time. Can be combined with trials and the billing cycle anchor.
    ///   - billingCycleAnchor: A future timestamp to anchor the subscription’s [billing cycle](https://stripe.com/docs/subscriptions/billing-cycle) . This is used to determine the date of the first full invoice, and, for plans with `month` or `year` intervals, the day of the month for subsequent invoices.
    ///   - billingThresholds: Define thresholds at which an invoice will be sent, and the subscription advanced to a new billing period. Pass an empty string to remove previously-defined thresholds.
    ///   - cancelAt: A timestamp at which the subscription should cancel. If set to a date before the current period ends, this will cause a proration if prorations have been enabled using proration_behavior. If set during a future period, this will always cause a proration for that period.
    ///   - collectionMethod: Either `charge_automatically`, or `send_invoice`. When charging automatically, Stripe will attempt to pay this subscription at the end of the cycle using the default source attached to the customer. When sending an invoice, Stripe will email your customer an invoice with payment instructions. Defaults to `charge_automatically`.
    ///   - coupon: The code of the coupon to apply to this subscription. A coupon applied to a subscription will only affect invoices created for that particular subscription. This will be unset if you POST an empty value.
    ///   - daysUntilDue: Number of days a customer has to pay invoices generated by this subscription. Valid only for subscriptions where `billing` is set to `send_invoice`.
    ///   - defaultSource: ID of the default payment source for the subscription. It must belong to the customer associated with the subscription and be in a chargeable state. If not set, defaults to the customer’s default source.
    ///   - defaultTaxRates: The tax rates that will apply to any subscription item that does not have `tax_rates` set. Invoices created will have their `default_tax_rates` populated from the subscription.
    ///   - offSession: Indicates if a customer is on or off-session while an invoice payment is attempted.
    ///   - onBehalfOf: The account on behalf of which to charge, for each of the subscription’s invoices.
    ///   - paymentSettings: Payment settings to pass to invoices created by the subscription.
    ///   - pendingInvoiceItemInterval: Specifies an interval for how often to bill for any pending invoice items. It is analogous to calling [Create an invoice](https://stripe.com/docs/api#create_invoice) for the given subscription at the specified interval.
    ///   - promotionCode: The API ID of a promotion code to apply to the customer. The customer will have a discount applied on all recurring payments. Charges you create through the API will not have the discount.
    ///   - prorationBehavior: Determines how to handle prorations resulting from the `billing_cycle_anchor`. Valid values are `create_prorations` or `none`. Passing `create_prorations` will cause proration invoice items to be created when applicable. Prorations can be disabled by passing `none`. If no value is passed, the default is `create_prorations`.
    ///   - transferData: If specified, the funds from the subscription’s invoices will be transferred to the destination and the ID of the resulting transfers will be found on the resulting charges.
    ///   - trialEnd: Unix timestamp representing the end of the trial period the customer will get before being charged for the first time. This will always overwrite any trials that might apply via a subscribed plan. If set, `trial_end` will override the default trial period of the plan the customer is being subscribed to. The special value now can be provided to end the customer’s trial immediately. Can be at most two years from `billing_cycle_anchor`.
    ///   - trialFromPlan: Indicates if a plan’s `trial_period_days` should be applied to the subscription. Setting `trial_end` per subscription is preferred, and this defaults to false. Setting this flag to true together with `trial_end` is not allowed.
    ///   - trialPeriodDays: Integer representing the number of trial period days before the customer is charged for the first time. This will always overwrite any trials that might apply via a subscribed plan.
    ///   - trialSettings: Settings related to subscription trials.
    ///   - expand: Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
    /// - Returns: The newly created Subscription object, if the call succeeded. If the attempted charge fails, the subscription is created in an incomplete status.

When changing plans or quantities, we will optionally prorate the price we charge next month to make up for any price changes. To preview how the proration will be calculated, use the [upcoming invoice](https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions/update#upcoming_invoice) endpoint.
    ///
    ///  By default, we prorate subscription changes. For example, if a customer signs up on May 1 for a $100 price, they'll be billed $100 immediately. If on May 15 they switch to a $200 price, then on June 1 they'll be billed $250 ($200 for a renewal of her subscription, plus a $50 prorating adjustment for half of the previous month's $100 difference). Similarly, a downgrade generates a credit that is applied to the next invoice. We also prorate when you make quantity changes.
    ///
    ///  Switching prices does not normally change the billing date or generate an immediate charge unless:
    ///  - The billing interval is changed (for example, from monthly to yearly).
    ///  - The subscription moves from free to paid, or paid to free.
    ///  - A trial starts or ends.
    ///
    /// In these cases, we apply a credit for the unused time on the previous price, immediately charge the customer using the new price, and reset the billing date.
    
    /// If you want to charge for an upgrade immediately, pass `proration_behavior` as `always_invoice` to create prorations, automatically invoice the customer for those proration adjustments, and attempt to collect payment. If you pass `create_prorations`, the prorations are created but not automatically invoiced. If you want to bill the customer for the prorations before the subscription's renewal date, you need to manually invoice the customer or use `pending_invoice_item_interval`.
    ///
    /// If you don't want to prorate, set the `proration_behavior` option to `none`. With this option, the customer is billed $100 on May 1 and $200 on June 1. Similarly, if you set `proration_behavior` to `none` when switching between different billing intervals (for example, from monthly to yearly), we don't generate any credits for the old subscription's unused time. We still reset the billing date and bill immediately for the new subscription.
    ///
    /// Updating the quantity on a subscription many times in an hour may result in [rate limiting](https://stripe.com/docs/rate-limits). If you need to bill for a frequently changing quantity, consider integrating [usage-based billing](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/usage-based) instead.

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - subscription: The ID of the subscription to update.

    ///   - paymentBehavior: Use `allow_incomplete` to transition the subscription to `status=past_due` if a payment is required but cannot be paid. This allows you to manage scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. For example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the SCA Migration Guide for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior. Use `default_incomplete` to transition the subscription to `status=past_due` when payment is required and await explicit confirmation of the invoice’s payment intent. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, SCA regulation, or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method. Use `pending_if_incomplete` to update the subscription using pending updates. When you use `pending_if_incomplete` you can only pass the parameters supported by pending updates. Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription’s invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not update the subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the changelog to learn more.
    ///   - prorationBehavior: Determines how to handle prorations when the billing cycle changes (e.g., when switching plans, resetting `billing_cycle_anchor=now`, or starting a trial), or if an item’s quantity changes.
