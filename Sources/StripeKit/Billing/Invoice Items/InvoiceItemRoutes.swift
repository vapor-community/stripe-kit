    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - customer: The ID of the customer who will be billed when this invoice item is billed.
    ///   - amount: The integer amount in cents of the charge to be applied to the upcoming invoice. If you want to apply a credit to the customer’s account, pass a negative amount.
    ///   - currency: Three-letter ISO currency code, in lowercase. Must be a supported currency.
    ///   - description: An arbitrary string which you can attach to the invoice item. The description is displayed in the invoice for easy tracking. This will be unset if you POST an empty value.
    ///   - metadata: A set of key-value pairs that you can attach to an invoice item object. It can be useful for storing additional information about the invoice item in a structured format.
    ///   - period: The period associated with this invoice item.
    ///   - price: The ID of the price object.
    ///   - discountable: Controls whether discounts apply to this invoice item. Defaults to false for prorations or negative invoice items, and true for all other invoice items.
    ///   - discounts: The coupons to redeem into discounts for the invoice item or invoice line item.
    ///   - invoice: The ID of an existing invoice to add this invoice item to. When left blank, the invoice item will be added to the next upcoming scheduled invoice. This is useful when adding invoice items in response to an invoice.created webhook. You can only add invoice items to draft invoices.
    ///   - priceData: Data used to generate a new price object inline.
    ///   - quantity: Non-negative integer. The quantity of units for the invoice item.
    ///   - subscription: The ID of a subscription to add this invoice item to. When left blank, the invoice item will be be added to the next upcoming scheduled invoice. When set, scheduled invoices for subscriptions other than the specified subscription will ignore the invoice item. Use this when you want to express that an invoice item has been accrued within the context of a particular subscription.
    ///   - taxBehavior: Only required if a default tax behavior was not provided in the Stripe Tax settings. Specifies whether the price is considered inclusive of taxes or exclusive of taxes. One of `inclusive`, `exclusive`, or `unspecified`. Once specified as either inclusive or exclusive, it cannot be changed.
    ///   - taxCode: A tax code ID.
    ///   - taxRates: The tax rates which apply to the invoice item. When set, the `default_tax_rates` on the invoice do not apply to this invoice item.
    ///   - unitAmount: The integer unit amount in cents of the charge to be applied to the upcoming invoice. This `unit_amount` will be multiplied by the quantity to get the full amount. If you want to apply a credit to the customer’s account, pass a negative `unit_amount`.
    ///   - unitAmountDecimal: Same as `unit_amount`, but accepts a decimal value with at most 12 decimal places. Only one of `unit_amount` and `unit_amount_decimal` can be set.
    ///   - expand: Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
    /// - Returns: The created invoice item object is returned if successful. Otherwise, this call returns an error.
