    /// You can create coupons easily via the [coupon management page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons) of the Stripe dashboard. Coupon creation is also accessible via the API if you need to create coupons on the fly.
    ///
    /// A coupon has either a `percent_off` or an `amount_off` and `currency`. If you set an `amount_off`, that amount will be subtracted from any invoice’s subtotal. For example, an invoice with a subtotal of $100 will have a final total of $0 if a coupon with an `amount_off` of 20000 is applied to it and an invoice with a subtotal of $300 will have a final total of $100 if a coupon with an `amount_off` of 20000 is applied to it.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - amountOff: A positive integer representing the amount to subtract from an invoice total (required if `percent_off` is not passed).
    ///   - duration: Specifies how long the discount will be in effect. Can be `forever`, `once`, or `repeating`.
    ///   - currency: Three-letter ISO code for the currency of the `amount_off` parameter (required if `amount_off` is passed).
    ///   - durationInMonths: Required only if `duration` is `repeating`, in which case it must be a positive integer that specifies the number of months the discount will be in effect.
    ///   - maxRedemptions: A positive integer specifying the number of times the coupon can be redeemed before it’s no longer valid. For example, you might have a 50% off coupon that the first 20 readers of your blog can use.
    ///   - metadata: A set of key-value pairs that you can attach to a coupon object. It can be useful for storing additional information about the coupon in a structured format.
    ///   - name: Name of the coupon displayed to customers on, for instance invoices, or receipts. By default the id is shown if name is not set.
    ///   - percentOff: A positive float larger than 0, and smaller or equal to 100, that represents the discount the coupon will apply (required if `amount_off` is not passed).
    ///   - id: Unique string of your choice that will be used to identify this coupon when applying it to a customer. If you don’t want to specify a particular code, you can leave the ID blank and we’ll generate a random code for you.
    ///   - appliesTo: A hash containing directions for what this Coupon will apply discounts to.
    ///   - currencyOptions: Coupons defined in each available currency option (only supported if `amount_off` is passed). Each key must be a three-letter ISO currency code and a supported currency. For example, to define your coupon in eur, pass the fields below in the eur key of `currency_options`.
    ///   - maxRedemptions: A positive integer specifying the number of times the coupon can be redeemed before it’s no longer valid. For example, you might have a 50% off coupon that the first 20 readers of your blog can use.
    ///   - redeemBy: Unix timestamp specifying the last time at which the coupon can be redeemed. After the `redeem_by` date, the coupon can no longer be applied to new customers.
    ///   - expand: Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
    /// - Returns: Returns the coupon object.
